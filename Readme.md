# What?
This repository contains the source code of **Sharif University of Technology**'s operating system course (ce-40424) individual assignments. The course is mainly based on **UC Berekely**'s *CS162* course. The three assignments here correspond to HW2, HW3, and HW4 of [this](https://cs162.org/). The repository is organized as followed:

`hw1/` A simple shell written in C.

`hw2/` A basic HTTP server with file serving and proxy modes

`hw3/` A simple implementation of a dynamic memory allocator

# Build and run
Running `make all` in each of three directories will compile the sources into an executable in the same directory. Refer to each subdirectory for more information on supported command line arguments.
